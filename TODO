TODO

Consider:

Can we watch:
  - a group of modules, or
  - main programs (with associated cpanfiles like Carton), or
  - a private repository (like a subset mirror of cpan)

so that any changes to any *dependency* will trigger a test of all the
affected modules?

Can this be integrated with an automated build or continuous-
integration system so that entire applications can be "pre-flight"
tested before deployment?
