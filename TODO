TODO

Consider:

Can we watch:
  - a group of modules, or
  - main programs (with associated cpanfiles like Carton), or
  - a private repository (like a subset mirror of cpan)

so that any changes to any *dependency* will trigger a test of all the
affected modules?

Can this be integrated with an automated build or continuous-
integration system so that entire applications can be "pre-flight"
tested before deployment?

cpanm module@version

but that does not give you control of dependencies
so... how do we totally control for regression testing?

consider looking at stratopan.com and Pinto
...and Nigel's tests

or: Docker.  Mount a set of depencies which all get deleted when
virtual machine closes, unless you specifically ask for them to remain

Slaven rezik ... has been trying to work on external/system
dependencies: cpan-sysdeps -- mapping to cpan modules, packages,
system packages probably something we want to use, to ensure that we
can indeed test a module



in valid.v3.json

...summary/{dist}/{version} ...
[add:]
{ "name": "grade",
  "in": "query"
  "description": "Filter results by grade",
  "type": "string",
  "enum": ["pass",.....


and then CPAN/TEsters/API/Controller/Summary.pm

in sub summary ($c) { ... } we add the validation->param(...)


and in t/controller/summary.t   ... add tests
